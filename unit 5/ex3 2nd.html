        <p align="center">Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually<br>
             refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software <br>
             
             development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop <br>
             browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has<br>
              become ever-increasingly important.<br>
