        <p align="center">Web design refers to the design of websites that<br>
            are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to<br> 
             the user experience aspects of website development rather than<br>
              software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites<br> 
              for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and <br>
              tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.<br></p>
